# FireStealer - 窃火者

[中文](https://github.com/shaokeyibb/FireStealer/blob/master/README.md) **English**

> The phlogiston theory is a superseded scientific theory that postulated the existence of a fire-like element called phlogiston (/flɒˈdʒɪstən, floʊ-, -ɒn/)[1][2] contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. —— [[Phlogiston theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory)

FireStealer is a magical Forge Mod based on phlogiston theory. We started from the world before the fire thief of Prometheus. There is no flame and no burning in the world. Players need to collect phlogiston and alchemy-related items, summon monsters in the temple, and finally fight against the gods to unlock the entire world of fire.
